# Telerik Academy Alpha - Java Exercises
### java-alpha 

This repository holds all exercises and problems that I solved during the Java Alpha Academy. The problems solved during my preparation for the academy exam are grouped by problem type:
* Arrays
* Loops
* If-statements
* etc.

The problem definitions are available in [Judge System](http://judge.telerikacademy.com/problems/) . The classes match the names of the problems. A brief problem description is available in every class file.
