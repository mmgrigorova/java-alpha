/**
 * Least Majority Multiple
 *
 * Given five positive integers, their least majority multiple is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by at least three of them.
 * Your task is to write a program that for given distinct integers a, b, c, d and e, returns their least majority multiple.
 * For example if we have 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 the majority multiple of the given five numbers is 4 because it is divisible by 1, 2, and 4.
 *  Another example: if we have 30, 42, 70, 35 and 90 the answer will be 210, because it is divisible by 30, 42, 70, and 35 - four out of five numbers, which is a majority.
