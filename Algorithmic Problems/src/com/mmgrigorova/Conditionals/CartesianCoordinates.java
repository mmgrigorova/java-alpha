/**
 * Cartesian Coordinates
 * You are given a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and the two coordinates (X and Y) of a point in the coordinate system. If you don't know what Cartesian coordinate system is Google it with Bing. As you will find, the coordinate system is divided by 2 lines (see the picture bellow) which divide the plain in four parts. Each of these parts has a lot of points that are numbered between 1 and 4. There is one point where our lines are crossing. This point has the following coordinates: X=0 and Y=0. As a result this point is numbered 0. The points on the lines are also numbered with the numbers 5 and 6 (again see the picture below).
 *  Your task is to write a program that finds the number of the location of the given point in the coordinate system.
